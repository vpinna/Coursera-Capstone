## Where is the best location to open an Italian Restaurant in San Francisco?

### 1. Introduction/Businness Problem
A couple of Italian Chefs is moving to San Fransisco and they want to open an Italian Restaurant there. They want to know where it will be the best place to open it.

### 2. Data
1) We will need a list of postal codes and neighborhoods of San Fransisco, in order to obtain their latitude and longitude and use Foursquare.
2) Use Foursquare to cluster neighborhoods and see how many italian restaurants are in each
3) Use Foursquare to know how restaurants in general are distributed in the city
4) Use Foursquare to see which kind of other businnesses are most popular in each one. 

We are looking for a place with no so many Italian Restaurants, but also preferibly a place with other businnesses, since their workers will have to eat around the same area.
